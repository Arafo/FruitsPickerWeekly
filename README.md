2- create a branch with your name `georges_jamous`

3- create a new file in root under `/solutions` with your name 

(example `/solutions/georges_jamous`)

4- duplicate the project under template `/template` inside the new folder under your name 

(example `/solutions/georges_jamous/FruitsApp`)

5- open your project (`/solutions/georges_jamous/FruitsApp`) and edit the code under the file `FruitsPickerView.swift` 

6- and commit/push to your private branch.

## NOTE:

if you have issues with pushing to this branch, then you need to:

1- fork the project

2- create a branch on your fork and work on it

3- open a PR from your Fork to this repository

You have been given a list of fruits already.
